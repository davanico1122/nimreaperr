# NIMREAPER RESEARCH FRAMEWORK

![Research Shield](https://img.shields.io/badge/Containment_Level-L4-red)
![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-6.0-blue)

Advanced cyber threat research framework simulating nation-state level capabilities for defensive research purposes.

## Containment Protocol

1. **Hardware Requirements**:

   * Dedicated air-gapped systems
   * Hardware virtualization support (Intel VT-x/AMD-V)
   * Minimum 16GB RAM, 100GB isolated storage

2. **Execution Environment**:

```bash
nim c -d:RESEARCH_MODE --cpu:amd64 -d:researchEnv nimreaper.nim
```

### Safety Features:

* Environment signature verification
* Hardware-based execution constraints
* Automatic shutdown on environment mismatch
* Activity logging with cryptographic seals

| monitorProcesses      | Security product detection     | Evasion technique analysis      |
| simulatePropagation   | Network spread simulation      | Worm behavior studies           |
| researchCommunication | C2 protocol simulation         | Command infrastructure research |

### Data Collection

```nim
proc collectResearchData(): SystemInfo
# Gathers 32 distinct system parameters
# Generates environment signature
# Detects security products and system configurations
```

### Threat Intelligence Integration

```nim
proc getThreatIntel()
# Connects to threat intelligence feeds
# Uses authenticated TLS channels
# Processes IOC updates and threat patterns
```

## Research Environment Setup

1. Create isolated virtual environment (VMware/VirtualBox)
2. Configure hardware parameters:

```bash
# Minimum hardware requirements
cpu: 4 cores
memory: 8192 MB
storage: 120 GB
network: Host-only adapter
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
# Windows research environment
choco install nim python openssl
refreshenv
nimble install winim nimcrypto zippy
```

4. Execute with research parameters:

```bash
nim c -d:RESEARCH_MODE --cpu:amd64 -d:release -d:researchEnv nimreaper.nim
./nimreaper
```

This enhanced framework provides:

* Rigorous safety controls for ethical research
* Advanced threat simulation capabilities
* Comprehensive documentation for institutional research
* Secure data handling and logging mechanisms
* Threat intelligence integration

> All features operate within strict ethical boundaries and require specialized containment environments for execution.
